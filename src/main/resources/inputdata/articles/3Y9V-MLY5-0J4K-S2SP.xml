Well, it appears to me that the Democratic activist, environmentalist complainers and news media are at it again. We have a Republican governor who once worked for Duke Energy, and all the problems with the power plant ash lakes are his fault. Where was the alarm for the past 75 or so years this same practice has been used to dispose of coal ash? I bet this same group would squeal even louder if the power in their neighborhoods were offline even for an hour or so.
Most of these same complainers don't like nuclear power, don't like dams on our rivers or windmills in their neighborhoods. They are also complaining about who is going to pay for this cleanup. I am sure it will not be the taxpayers, as was the case a few years ago when something on an even larger scale happened at a government-owned TVA plant in Tennessee.
Duke Energy is a good corporate company and will do the right thing. You do not get free power or a free ride when the sun doesn't shine. If we did, then there would be some would complaints about that also. P.S. - Gov. McCrory, please keep up the good work.
