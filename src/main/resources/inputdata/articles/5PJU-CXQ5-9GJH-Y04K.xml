The collapse killed more than 1,100 people and highlighted the grim conditions in Bangladesh's garment industry, a major supplier to global fashion brands.
Mojtaba Kazazi, executive commissioner of Rana Plaza Claims Administration, said Monday injured workers and families of the dead should have compensation payments in six months.
Retailers like Bonmarché, El Corte Ingles, Loblaw and Primark have pledged $40 million for the fund.
