The environmental group made the allegations in a letter to Minnesota Power executives. According to the Star Tribune, the Sierra Club threatened litigation over measurements showing high opacity levels, which it links&amp;nbsp;to high levels of soot.&amp;nbsp;
The Duluth-based company, however, contends that the plants operate under opacity limits 99.7 percent of the time&amp;nbsp;and that high opacity levels don't necessarily mean higher pollution levels. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency agrees, and told the Star Tribune it doesn't plan enforcement action.&amp;nbsp;
The three plants are in Boswell, Taconite Harbor and Laskin, Minn.&amp;nbsp;
