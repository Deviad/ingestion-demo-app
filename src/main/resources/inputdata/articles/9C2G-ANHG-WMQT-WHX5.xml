Several of the protesters sprawled on a black plastic tarp representing an oil spill (above). The Keystone expansion would carry 800,000 barrels a day of crude oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Opponents contend the pipeline, which is awaiting approval of President Obama, would further expand harmful effects of climate change attributed to the use and extraction of fossil fuels.
