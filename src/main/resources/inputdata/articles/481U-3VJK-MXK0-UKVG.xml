Christine Lagarde, who is not seen as an official suspect in the case, is accused of abusing her old position as French finance minister to help a controversial businessman.
The 58-yearold allegedly helped Bernard Tapie, who believed he was defrauded by a state bank after he sold adidas, the sportswear company which he majority owned.
A Paris court is investigating whether the payout he received was too generous as Tapie backed Nicholas Sarkozy's bid to be French president. Also in court is Stephane Richard, the CEO of mobile phone group Orange, who was Lagarde's chief of staff during her time in office. Lagarde and Richard deny wrongdoing at the Court of Justice of the Republic.
