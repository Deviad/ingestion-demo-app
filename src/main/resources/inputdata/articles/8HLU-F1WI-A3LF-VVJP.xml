It's the sixth modification to Glencore/Xstrata's Mangoola mine, formerly known as Anvil Hill.
The company wants to boost mining activity by extracting another three million tonnes of coal a year. Submissions from residents, conservation groups, wineries and the surrounding community highlight several concerns about the mine's plan to increase extraction rates by a third.
Several submissions have raised concern about noise and amenity impacts on nearby residents, as well as plans to discharge saline mine water into the Hunter River.
The New South Wales Government's planning system has also been criticised for allowing the mine to make numerous modifications to its initial consent.
One submission says the modifications in isolation could be deemed minor, but together they represent a significant change to the company's overall mining operations and impact on local communities.
There is also concern about impacts on property values, health and the environment.
Mangoola has lodged a report on the Planning department's website responding to the concerns.
It says the latest modification will shorten the mine's life, improve sound mitigation measures, and is not predicted to significantly affect property values.
