Minnesota Public Radio has a&amp;nbsp;report on what the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources&amp;nbsp;terms a passing grade&amp;nbsp; from the&amp;nbsp;EPA&amp;nbsp;for the controversial project, which was cheered by St. Paul-based PolyMet
"We appreciate the extensive improvements to the project and the clarity and completeness of the environmental review," the EPA said in a letter to the DNR and its co-lead agencies, the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
PolyMet's mine plan has drawn packed crowds across the state, which have been largely split between proponents of the idea, who say it'll bring new jobs to northern Minnesota, and environmental and tourism-industry advocates who worry about water contamination.
St. Paul-based PolyMet has already spent about $150 million on its Hoyt Lakes mining project.
